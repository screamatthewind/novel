## 📖 What This Novel Is About

**Logline**: When Emma Chen loses her manufacturing job to automated systems, she discovers a global pattern of human obsolescence—and joins a network building alternatives based on a radical bet: that human meaning matters more than efficiency.

**The Central Question**: What happens when optimized systems no longer need humans?

**The Answer**: People walk away from perfect efficiency toward messy meaning.
