This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a creative writing project for a novel titled "The Obsolescence". The repository contains Markdown documents organized as follows:

- **[The_Obsolescence_Novel_Bible.md](The_Obsolescence_Novel_Bible.md)** - World-building reference, character profiles, and core concepts
- **[The_Obsolescence_Novel_Outline.md](The_Obsolescence_Novel_Outline.md)** - Story structure and chapter-by-chapter outline
- **[The_Obsolescence_Chapter_One.md](The_Obsolescence_Chapter_One.md)** through **[The_Obsolescence_Chapter_Four.md](The_Obsolescence_Chapter_Four.md)** - Individual chapter manuscripts

## Working with This Project

### Document Priority

When assisting with this novel:

1. **Always consult the Novel Bible first** - It contains the canonical world-building, character details, and thematic elements that must remain consistent across all chapters
2. **Reference the Outline** - Check the outline to understand where each chapter fits in the overall story arc before making suggestions
3. **Maintain continuity** - When editing or reviewing chapters, cross-reference earlier chapters to ensure consistency in character voices, plot details, and world-building

### File Naming Convention

Chapter files follow the pattern: `The_Obsolescence_Chapter_[Name].md` where Name is the spelled-out number (One, Two, Three, Four, etc.)

### Project Structure

The novel is organized in four parts:
- **Part One: The Awakening** - Emma Chen's journey from layoff to understanding (Chapters 1-3, drafted)
- **Part Two: The Pattern** - Global perspectives: Maxim Orlov (Russia), Amara Okafor (Kenya) (Chapter 4 drafted, Chapter 5 outlined)
- **Part Three: The Machines** - Time jump to 2029, humanoid robot deployment, Wei Chen's perspective (outlined)
- **Part Four: The Obsolescence** - Speculative future 2032-2045, the Remainder communities (outlined)

### Key Considerations

- All edits should be made directly to the Markdown files
- When providing edits, reference specific line numbers or sections
- Maintain the established tone, style, and voice present in existing chapters
- All statistics and data in Parts 1-2 are sourced from real-world research (see Novel Bible section 8)

### Tonal Guidance

**CRITICAL: This is entertainment first, education second**

- Technology has tonal range—thrilling, mundane, terrifying, often simultaneously
- The soft-sell is key: robots as backup dancers are genuinely cool before revealing they're the same models used in factories/military
- Climate change is background texture only—brief sensory details, never explained, makes everything else worse
- Information introduced gradually through character experience, never info-dumps
- Avoid one-note dystopian gloom—embrace complexity, uncertainty, earned emotions
