PART FOUR

The Obsolescence

CHAPTER NINE

The Severance

Ohio — January 2032

Tyler sat at the kitchen table, staring at the rejection email. Not even a form letter this time. Just: "Position filled. Thank you for your interest."

The seventy-third application. The seventy-third no.

He'd been trying for eight months. Sent résumés to engineering firms, manufacturing companies, tech startups. Anything remotely related to his degree.

Nothing.

Emma found him there at noon, still in yesterday's clothes.

"Ty?"

"Another no." His voice was flat. "I'm twenty-four. I have a degree from a good school. I've been working at the maker space, learning practical skills. And I can't get a job doing anything."

Emma sat beside him. She didn't have platitudes anymore. They'd all been exhausted months ago.

"The maker space—" she started.

"Isn't a job, Mom. It's volunteer work. Meaningful volunteer work, but it doesn't pay my student loans or help me move out of your house or make me feel like less of a failure."

"You're not a failure."

"Then what am I? Because I'm not employed. I'm not building a career. I'm not doing any of the things I was told I'd be doing if I worked hard and got educated and played by the rules." He looked at her. "What's the point, Mom? Seriously. What am I supposed to do with my life?"

Emma didn't have an answer.

Mark had been laid off in November. Insurance companies didn't need human customer service anymore—AI chatbots handled everything faster and more accurately. He'd been applying for jobs too. Same results as Tyler.

Their savings were draining. Mortgage payments coming from retirement accounts now. They had maybe a year before serious financial crisis.

The maker spaces were struggling too. People couldn't afford membership fees. Donations had dried up. Emma was running three locations on fumes and volunteer labor.

She'd dedicated four years to building resilience, teaching skills, preparing communities.

And watching it all slowly collapse under the weight of economics that didn't include human participation.

"I don't know, Ty," she admitted. "I thought we were building something that would matter. Help people through the transition. But the transition is faster and harder than anyone predicted. I don't have good answers anymore."

Tyler nodded slowly. "At least you're honest about it."

They sat in silence in the kitchen. Outside, a delivery drone hummed past. Automated, efficient, replacing another job that used to support a family.

Everything worked perfectly.

Nobody needed them.

Togliatti, Russia — February 2032

Sergei died on a Tuesday.

Maxim found him in his apartment—empty bottles, pills, a note that just said *I'm sorry.*

Katya was devastated. "He was doing better. I thought he was okay."

"He wasn't okay," Maxim said gently. "None of us are. We're just better at hiding it."

The funeral was small. Sergei's wife had left him two years ago. His daughter Katya was all he had. And Maxim, and a few former coworkers from the factory that had closed six years ago.

"He built perfect frames for thirty years," Maxim said at the gravesite. "Taught me everything I know about precision. About pride in work. About craftsmanship."

He wanted to say more. That Sergei's skills mattered. That his knowledge was valuable. That the world was wrong to treat him as obsolete.

But standing there in the February cold, watching them lower his friend into frozen ground, the words felt empty.

Maybe Sergei was right. Maybe they were obsolete. Maybe all the workshop training and skill preservation was just pretending that humans still mattered in a world designed to run without them.

After the funeral, Katya asked, "Should we close the workshop? What's the point?"

Maxim wanted to give her hope. Tell her it mattered, that they were helping people.

But he'd lost count of his former students who'd given up. Who'd moved away seeking work that didn't exist. Who'd stopped coming because they couldn't afford food, let alone workshop fees.

"I don't know," he admitted. "Maybe."

They stood in the workshop that night, surrounded by tools and half-finished projects. Evidence of effort. Not evidence of success.

"My father believed in this," Katya said. "Teaching the next generation. Preserving knowledge. He thought it would matter when the systems failed."

"The systems haven't failed. They're working perfectly. We're the ones failing."

"So we just give up?"

Maxim looked at his hands. Calloused from decades of work. Skilled at fixing things nobody wanted fixed anymore.

"I don't know what else to do."

* * *

Nairobi, Kenya — March 2032

The cooperative's fields were failing.

Amara walked through rows of wilted crops. The drought had been bad this year—climate stress making everything harder. But it wasn't just weather.

The Chinese agricultural corporations had bought up surrounding land. Automated farming operations—robots planting, tending, harvesting with perfect efficiency. They'd diverted water sources, outcompeted local markets, made traditional farming economically impossible.

Seventy of Amara's ninety cooperatives had collapsed in the last six months.

The communities she'd spent years helping build self-sufficiency were being absorbed back into dependency. Not because they'd failed. Because they couldn't compete with perfect automation.

"We tried," said Mary, one of the cooperative leaders. "We grew good food. Built community. Did everything you taught us."

"I know."

"But it wasn't enough. The corporations can undercut our prices. They have robots that work 24/7. Access to resources we can't match. We can't survive against that."

Amara wanted to argue. Say resilience mattered more than efficiency. That community was worth more than cheap food.

But Mary's children were hungry. The co-op members needed income. Pride didn't feed families.

"What will you do?" Amara asked.

"Work for the Chinese farms. They pay minimal wages, terrible conditions. But it's something." Mary's eyes were hard. "We tried your way. It didn't work. Now we do what we have to."

After Mary left, Amara sat in the empty field. Around her, the infrastructure she'd built to help people be independent was crumbling.

She'd resigned from government to avoid being part of the dependency system.

But the dependency system didn't need her participation. It won anyway.

Her phone rang. Elena, from the network.

"Amara, how are things?"

"Collapsing. The cooperatives are failing. People are giving up, going back to the systems we were trying to give them alternatives to."

"I'm hearing similar stories everywhere. The network is shrinking. People can't afford to keep building alternatives when they're struggling to survive."

"We failed, Elena. We had four years to build something resilient. And it's falling apart."

Elena was quiet for a moment. "Maybe. Or maybe we built wrong. Maybe small pictures weren't enough. Maybe we needed something larger."

"It's too late for that now."

"I know."

They sat with the silence.

"I'm thinking of stopping," Amara said. "The cooperatives. The organizing. All of it. What's the point of fighting a system that wins no matter what we do?"

"I can't tell you not to. I'm tired too."

Amara ended the call. Sat in the failed field.

Thought about the beautiful railway that had started this—gleaming, efficient, built with debt that had strangled Kenya's economy.

She'd thought she was building roads.

She'd been building chains.

And now she'd tried to break the chains with community agriculture.

The chains won anyway.

Beijing — April 2032

Wei Chen no longer worked at the think tank.

The security review had found nothing actionable—his operational security had been good enough. But his clearance was revoked. He was quietly moved to a university teaching position. Prestigious, comfortable, irrelevant.

Surveillance on his family had increased. Lihua was followed to school. Mei's architecture work was "audited" monthly. They lived in a cage of polite monitoring.

The price of his help to the network.

Lihua was seventeen now. Should be thinking about university. Instead, she was depressed.

"Why bother, Bàba? What's the point of studying if there's nothing to do after? No work, no purpose. The machines do everything."

"There's always meaning in learning—"

"Don't." Her voice was sharp. "Don't give me philosophical comfort. I'm asking practical questions. What am I supposed to do with my life in a world that doesn't need me?"

Wei had no answer.

Because she was right. The systems had succeeded. Automation was ubiquitous. Human labor wasn't just unnecessary—it was a friction point in optimized systems.

His daughter was economically obsolete before she'd even started.

"I'm sorry," he said finally. "I helped design this. I thought I was solving problems. I was creating them."

"I know. You've said that." Lihua looked at him with something like pity. "And you tried to help people prepare. The network you wouldn't talk about but we all knew about anyway. That was good. But it didn't work, did it?"

"How do you know?"

"Because things are getting worse, not better. Unemployment is insane. People are desperate. And the government is cracking down—surveillance, controls, automated enforcement systems. Your resistance network or whatever it was got crushed by the systems you designed to be un-crushable."

Wei wanted to argue. But she was right about that too.

The network had been a bet. That human meaning would matter more than efficiency. That people would choose connection over optimization.

But when people were starving, they chose survival. And survival meant submission to the automated systems, however purposeless that made their lives.

The bet had failed.

At night, Wei wrote in his journal—still encrypted, still careful.

*I told Elena the systems had a fatal flaw. That they'd optimized away meaning. That people would reject purposeless efficiency.*

*I was wrong.*

*People can't reject systems they depend on for survival. And we made them dependent on everything. Food, power, water, work—all controlled by automated systems they can't escape.*

*The network tried to build alternatives. But alternatives need time, resources, social space. When the systems accelerate faster than alternatives can grow, there's no escape.*

*We lost. The systems won. Human obsolescence is real.*

*I don't know what to tell my daughter about her future. Because I can't imagine a good one for her in the world I helped create.*

He closed the journal. Deleted it entirely—too risky to keep even encrypted thoughts anymore.

Sat in his monitored apartment in the optimized city and felt the full weight of what he'd designed.

Perfect efficiency.

Perfect control.

Perfect emptiness.

* * *

Washington DC — June 2032

Elena's rowhouse felt like a tomb.

The network calls had dwindled. From 65,000 active participants to maybe 20,000. People giving up, dropping out, focusing on immediate survival.

The maker spaces, workshops, cooperatives—most had closed. The ones still running were shells, hanging on through sheer stubbornness.

Emma called less often. When she did, she sounded defeated.

"Tyler's depressed. Really depressed. Won't get out of bed some days. I'm scared, Elena."

"I'm sorry. How can I help?"

"You can't. Nobody can. We told him the world would need human skills. That meaning mattered. And then the world demonstrated it didn't. We gave him hope and it was a lie."

"It wasn't a lie. We believed—"

"We were wrong. We built lifeboats for a flood that never came. The systems didn't collapse. They just made us irrelevant. And all our preparation, all our alternatives—it didn't matter."

Elena had no counter-argument.

From Kenya, Amara had stopped organizing entirely. Taken a job with one of the Chinese agricultural corporations. The irony was bitter, but she had bills to pay.

From Russia, Maxim's workshop was closed. He worked odd jobs, what few existed. Katya had moved to Moscow, looking for anything.

The network had failed.

The bet had failed.

Elena sat in her rowhouse surrounded by maps and data that no longer mattered. Evidence of effort. Not evidence of success.

She'd spent years believing human meaning couldn't be automated. That systems treating people as problems would collapse under their own logic.

But the systems hadn't collapsed. They'd succeeded.

And the people—billions of them—were just... unnecessary. Economically superfluous. Deliberately obsolete.

Her phone rang. A number she didn't recognize.

"Elena Volkov?"

"Yes?"

"I'm calling about your network. The resistance infrastructure you've been building."

Elena's blood went cold. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"Please, Dr. Volkov. We're not hostile. We're academics studying social responses to automation. Your work is fascinating. We'd like to interview you about the failure."

"The failure."

"Yes. The network's dissolution. What went wrong. Why the alternative systems couldn't compete. It's important data for understanding technological transitions."

Elena laughed bitterly. "You want me to explain how we failed so you can document it? For posterity?"

"For scholarship. Yes."

"No. Figure it out yourself." She hung up.

But the question lingered: *What went wrong?*

She'd believed in human resilience. Human meaning. The irreducible fact that people mattered in ways optimization couldn't capture.

She'd been wrong.

Or too early.

Or too late.

It didn't matter which.

She looked at the third monitor—the one where the network calls used to happen. Dark now. Silent.

Sixty-five thousand people at the peak. Building alternatives. Learning resilience. Preparing for the systems to fail.

The systems never failed.

The people did.

* * *

Columbus, Ohio — December 2032

Tyler finally got a job.

Warehouse work. A massive automated facility where robots did 95% of the labor. He was one of fifty humans overseeing ten thousand machines.

The pay was minimum wage. The work was mindless. Stand. Watch. Press emergency stop if something goes catastrophically wrong, which it never does.

"How is it?" Emma asked at dinner.

"It's something."

"Are you... okay?"

Tyler looked at his mother. She'd aged a decade in the last year. The maker spaces had closed. Mark was working part-time at a grocery store. They'd downsized to a smaller apartment. Everything they'd built had crumbled.

"No, Mom. I'm not okay. I watch robots do meaningful work while I stand there being paid minimum wage to exist near them. I'm a decoration. An anachronism. Proof that humans used to matter." He paused. "I'm twenty-five. This is my life now. This is all it'll ever be."

"Tyler—"

"Don't. Please don't tell me it'll get better or that I matter or that meaning isn't about employment. Because I'm exhausted from trying to believe that." He stood up. "I'm going to bed. Early shift tomorrow. Can't disappoint the robots."

After he left, Emma sat with Mark in silence.

"We failed him," she said.

"We tried—"

"We told him human skills would matter. That the world would need people who could make things, fix things, think things. And instead he's watching robots because the insurance won't let the robots run completely unsupervised." She felt tears on her face. "We gave him hope that was a lie."

Mark held her while she cried.

Outside, the world continued. Optimized. Efficient. Automated.

Working perfectly.

Needing nobody.

* * *

A compilation of messages from December 2032:

**Emma to Elena:** *The last maker space closed today. Can't afford the rent. Maybe 200 people total ever really learned anything useful. Against millions unemployed in Ohio alone, we didn't matter. I'm sorry.*

**Maxim to Elena:** *Workshop is gone. Sergei's death broke something. Without him, I couldn't keep believing it mattered. Teaching obsolete skills for an obsolete world. I don't know what I'm doing anymore.*

**Amara to Elena:** *Working for the corporations I swore I'd resist. Need the money. The cooperatives were beautiful but they weren't viable. I'm sorry I couldn't make it work.*

**Wei (from anonymous account) to Elena:** *My daughter asked if life has meaning when humans aren't needed. I couldn't answer her. All my theories about systems collapsing from purposelessness—wrong. The systems work. We're the ones broken. I'm sorry.*

Elena read them all. Sitting in her rowhouse that felt empty now.

Wrote one response, sent to everyone:

*You did what you could. We all did. We were wrong about the timeline, wrong about the systems failing, maybe wrong about human meaning mattering more than efficiency. But you tried. That counts for something.*

*I don't know what comes next. The bet failed. The network failed. Maybe we failed.*

*But thank you for trying. For believing, for a while, that there was an alternative worth building.*

*I'm tired too.*

*Be well.*

*—E*

She sent it. Closed her laptop. Sat in the dark.

The maps on the walls showed a world reorganized around automation. Human labor obsolete. Human meaning automated away.

The network had tried to build alternatives.

The alternatives hadn't survived contact with reality.

Sixty-five thousand people. Years of work. All the hope they'd built together.

Failed.

Elena looked at the dark monitor where faces used to appear. Where voices used to share small victories and stubborn hope.

Silent now.

She'd told them they were building lifeboats.

Turned out they were building dreams.

And dreams didn't float.


CRAFT NOTES: CHAPTER NINE

Total, Intimate, Devastating

This is the emotional nadir. Not abstract collapse—deeply personal suffering for every character we care about.

Tyler's depression. Sergei's suicide. Amara's surrender. Wei's failure to answer his daughter. Elena's network dissolving.

Each person facing the complete failure of everything they built.

Not Dramatic—Grinding

The collapse isn't explosive. It's quiet despair:
- 73rd job rejection
- Sergei found dead, alone
- Cooperatives failing to weather competition
- Tyler watching robots for minimum wage
- Network calls dwindling from 65,000 to 20,000

Reality grinding down hope slowly.

The Bet Failed

Every character confronts it:
- Emma: "We gave him hope that was a lie"
- Maxim: "Teaching obsolete skills for an obsolete world"
- Amara: "We tried your way. It didn't work"
- Wei: "The bet had failed"
- Elena: "Dreams didn't float"

The central thesis—human meaning mattering more than efficiency—appears disproven.

Systems Worked Too Well

Critical point: the automated systems DIDN'T fail. They succeeded perfectly.

The network was betting on system collapse creating space for alternatives. Instead, the systems just made humans obsolete.

This makes the defeat total. They weren't wrong about execution. They were wrong about the fundamental dynamic.

Personal Devastation for Each Character

Tyler: Depression, minimum-wage warehouse work, living with parents at 25
Emma: All three maker spaces closed, Tyler's suffering, savings drained
Mark: Laid off, working part-time grocery
Maxim: Sergei's death, workshop closed, faith broken
Katya: Father's suicide, moving away defeated
Amara: Working for the corporations she resisted, cooperatives failed
Wei: Daughter depressed, family monitored, can't imagine her future
Lihua: Economically obsolete before starting life
Elena: Network dissolved, 20,000 from 65,000, everything failed

No one is okay. Everyone lost.

The Necessary Darkness

This chapter is hard to read. That's the point.

We've spent 8 chapters building hope, showing small victories, watching the network grow. All of that needed to crash completely to make the recovery in Chapters 10-11 earned.

False hope is worse than no hope. This chapter shows the reader and characters that easy answers don't work. Systems are powerful. Resistance is hard.

Makes what comes next more valuable.

Emotional Honesty

Characters don't have false comfort:
- Emma admits she doesn't have answers
- Maxim says "Maybe we should close the workshop"
- Amara stops organizing entirely
- Elena acknowledges "We were wrong"

No one pretending. Just exhausted people who tried and failed.

The Compilation of Messages

The string of defeat messages to Elena is devastating. Each person apologizing for not being able to make it work.

Elena's response acknowledging failure makes it worse. She can't rally them anymore. She's defeated too.

The Systems Work Perfectly

Ironic throughout:
- Delivery drones humming past
- Robots in Tyler's warehouse never failing
- Automated agriculture outcompeting cooperatives
- Everything optimized and efficient

The dystopia isn't broken systems. It's working systems that don't need humans.

This Is Lost

No silver lining. No "but at least..." moments. Just total defeat.

The chapter earns the title of Part Four: "The Obsolescence"

Humans are obsolete. The systems proved it. The network's resistance failed.

This is the bottom. Necessary to make the climb back up meaningful.

All Is Lost

The requirement from the outline: "All is lost. Intimate suffering. The sense that they fought and lost."

Delivered.

Now we see if they can find a way back.
