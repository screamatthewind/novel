CHAPTER TEN

The Remainder

Rural Ohio — Spring 2035

Emma stood in what used to be a strip mall and was now something else entirely.

The old retail spaces had been converted into workshops. Metalworking in what was once a cell phone store. Woodworking where a Subway used to be. Electronics repair in the former Dollar General.

Sixty people worked at various stations—not for pay, but for food, barter, community credit. The economy had shifted to something post-monetary for most people. You contributed what you could, took what you needed, trusted the system balanced out.

It mostly did.

Tyler ran the metal shop. Twenty-eight now, still living with Emma and Mark, but different than three years ago. Less defeated. More purposeful.

"We got a request from the agricultural commune," he told Emma. "They need replacement parts for their irrigation system. Chinese manufacturer went bankrupt, no official parts available."

"Can you make them?"

"Yeah. I've got the specs, the materials. Take about a week." He paused. "They're offering forty pounds of vegetables and some dairy credits in exchange."

"That's fair."

Emma watched him work—measuring, cutting, welding. The skills she'd tried to teach at the maker spaces, back when maker spaces were a thing.

The maker spaces had failed. But the skills hadn't.

When the systems started cracking—slowly at first, then cascading—people remembered who knew how to fix things. Make things. Improvise solutions when official channels broke down.

Tyler and his generation hadn't gotten the careers they were promised. But they'd gotten something else. Purpose. Usefulness. A role that mattered in a world that looked nothing like anyone expected.

"How many requests this month?" Emma asked.

"Forty-three. Up from thirty-two last month. Word's spreading—there's a place in Columbus where people can get things made and fixed without needing money or official supply chains."

"We'll need more metal stock."

"Already sourcing it. There's a salvage collective in Cleveland pulling material from abandoned buildings. We trade them repair work for raw materials."

Emma smiled. Four years ago, this would have seemed dystopian. Trading vegetables for metalworking, salvaging abandoned buildings for material.

Now it just seemed practical.

The automated systems were still running in the big cities—the zones that had maintained infrastructure and technical expertise. But huge swaths of the country had been deemed not worth automating, not worth maintaining, not worth including in the optimized economy.

Those places had been abandoned by the official systems.

They'd started calling themselves the Remainder.

What remained when efficiency optimized you away.

And the Remainder was learning to survive.

Maxim — Russia, Small Town Near Togliatti — Summer 2036

The workshop was smaller than before. Just one building, ten students at a time.

But it was functioning.

Maxim taught a young woman named Vera how to rebuild a generator—old diesel model, Soviet-era, the kind everyone said was obsolete.

"Why learn this?" she asked. "The official zones have modern power systems."

"And if you want to live in official zones, plugged into their grid, dependent on their systems, go ahead." Maxim gestured at the generator. "But if you want to live out here, where we control our own power, our own food, our own time—you need to know how things actually work."

Vera nodded, focused. Twenty-two, university educated, no job prospects in the official economy. So she'd come to the Remainder, learning to be useful in different ways.

After the session, Katya brought tea.

"Fifteen students this month. Twenty last month. We're growing again."

"Because the official zones are shrinking," Maxim said. "Fewer cities maintaining full automation. More regions abandoned."

"Is that good?"

Maxim thought about it. The last few years had been harsh. After Sergei's death, after the workshop closed, he'd worked random jobs, barely surviving. Watched Russia fragment into automated Moscow and St. Petersburg, resource-extraction zones serving Chinese industry, and vast abandoned areas where the state just... left.

The official story was "economic rationalization." The reality was triage. Maintain the zones worth maintaining. Abandon the rest.

The Remainder had formed in those abandoned spaces.

"It's not good or bad," Maxim said finally. "It's just what is. The systems optimized for efficiency. Turns out that means concentrating resources in profitable areas, withdrawing from everywhere else. We're everywhere else."

"And we're surviving."

"Yes. Not thriving. But surviving. Building systems that work for us, on our terms."

Katya looked at the workshop—students learning obsolete skills for an obsolete world that was somehow still running.

"My father would have liked this. The workshop reopened. Teaching continuing. Small scale, but real."

"He would have." Maxim raised his tea cup. "To Sergei. Who taught me that meaning matters more than efficiency."

"To Sergei."

The Remainder wasn't what any of them had imagined. It wasn't victory. But it wasn't defeat either.

It was a third option, emerging in the cracks.

* * *

Nairobi, Kenya — Fall 2036

Amara walked through the agricultural collective—twenty families, two hundred acres, completely off-grid from the Chinese corporate farms.

She'd worked for the corporations for two years. Saved money. Left the moment she had enough to start over.

This wasn't the same as the old cooperatives. Those had tried to compete with the corporate system—produce food cheaper, better, more efficiently.

These new collectives didn't compete. They withdrew.

Produced food for themselves and local communities. Traded surplus with other Remainder groups. Operated entirely outside the official economy.

"How's the harvest?" she asked Joseph, one of the collective leaders.

"Good. Not record-breaking, but good. We'll have surplus to trade."

"The corporations?"

"Still there. Still efficient. Still producing cheap food for the official zones." Joseph smiled. "But we're not trying to beat them anymore. We're just trying to feed ourselves. Different goal. Different metrics."

Amara understood. The old cooperatives had failed because they'd accepted the competition on the system's terms. These new ones succeeded by opting out entirely.

"How many collectives in Kenya now?"

"Maybe forty still running. Different than before—smaller, more focused on local sufficiency. The ones that tried to grow big and compete all collapsed. The ones that stayed small and autonomous are doing okay."

"Forty from ninety. That's still losing most of them."

"Maybe. Or maybe it's finding the right size. Not everything needs to scale." Joseph looked at the fields. "We feed ourselves. We feed our neighbors. We trade with allies. We're not saving Kenya. But we're living with dignity. That's enough."

Amara thought about the belt and road railway. Still running, still beautiful, still binding Kenya to debt it would never pay off.

The official economy was trapped in that system. The Remainder had walked away from it.

"Elena called," she told Joseph. "Network is reorganizing. Not like before—no grand plans. Just connecting the groups that survived. Sharing knowledge. Supporting each other."

"Are you joining?"

"I think so. We learned a lot from failing. Might be worth sharing that knowledge with others trying to build alternatives."

"What did we learn?"

Amara smiled bitterly. "Don't compete with optimal systems. Don't try to scale. Don't depend on anyone outside your community. Stay small, stay local, stay autonomous."

"That's a depressing list."

"Yes. But it's what works. The Remainder isn't glorious. But it's survivable."

* * *

Columbus, Ohio — Winter 2037

Tyler met Hannah at a tool-sharing event.

She was twenty-six, former software engineer, now running a community repair center. Smart, practical, shared his dark sense of humor about the world they'd inherited.

They started talking. Kept talking. Started working together on projects.

After three months, Tyler realized he was happy.

Not the happiness he'd expected—career success, financial security, hitting life milestones. Different happiness. Purpose. Connection. Building something that mattered to people he cared about.

"I'm thinking about having kids," Hannah said one night.

Tyler almost laughed. "In this world? Why would we do that?"

"Because the world, whatever it looks like, needs next generations. And I think we could raise a kid who's useful, resilient, purposeful." She looked at him. "I'm not saying now. But eventually. Maybe."

Tyler thought about it. Three years ago, he'd been depressed, watching robots, wondering what the point of existence was.

Now he was making parts for irrigation systems, teaching metalworking to teenagers, trading labor for food, dating someone he liked, contemplating a future that included children.

"It's weird," he said. "The economy collapsed, most jobs disappeared, the official systems abandoned us. And somehow I'm more okay than I was when I had a college degree and prospects."

"Because you matter now. To actual people. For real reasons." Hannah smiled. "Turns out that's more important than GDP."

"Is it enough? For a life?"

"I think it might be. Not easy. But enough."

Tyler pulled her close. Outside, the Remainder continued—messy, inefficient, human.

"Yeah," he said. "Maybe it is."

* * *

Beijing — Spring 2038

Wei Chen walked through the automated zone with his grandson.

Lihua had met someone. Another young person as depressed and purposeless as she'd been. They'd found purpose in each other, at least. Gotten married. Had a child.

Little Jian was four years old now. Curious about everything.

"Yéye, why don't those people work?" he asked, pointing at a group of unemployed youth gathering in a park.

"The systems don't need their labor," Wei explained. "Robots and AI do everything faster and better."

"Then what do they do?"

Wei didn't have a good answer. In the automated zones, the question haunted everything. Millions of economically unnecessary people, maintained through basic support systems, nothing meaningful to do.

Depression rates were catastrophic. Birth rates near zero. People just... existing. Sustained by optimal systems that didn't need them.

"Some of them leave," Wei said. "Go to the Remainder zones. Places where the state withdrew infrastructure, where communities build their own systems."

"Is that bad?"

"The official position is yes. Those zones are inefficient, underdeveloped, backwards." Wei paused. "But the people there seem more alive than the people here."

Lihua had been talking about leaving. Taking Jian to one of the Remainder zones, finding a community, contributing labor instead of being sustained.

Wei understood the urge. The automated zones were comfortable, secure, efficient.

And utterly purposeless.

"I helped design this," he told his grandson, even though Jian was too young to understand. "The optimal systems. Perfect efficiency. And I thought I was solving problems."

"Did you?"

"I solved the wrong problems. Made systems that didn't need humans. And now we're all stuck in them."

At home, Lihua talked about her plans.

"There's a Remainder community in Sichuan Province. Former engineers, mostly. They're building small-scale manufacturing using salvaged equipment. Teaching skills, training the next generation. I think I want to go there."

"With Jian?"

"Yes. I want him to grow up useful. To learn to make things, fix things, contribute meaningfully. Here..." She gestured at their comfortable apartment. "Here he'll just be sustained. Like all of us. Comfortable and empty."

Mei asked, "Is it safe? The Remainder zones?"

"Safer than you'd think. The state ignores them mostly—not worth the resources to maintain control. They're outside the official economy but functioning. Different, but functioning."

Wei thought about the network he'd helped. Most of it had collapsed in 2032. But some communities had survived, adapted, learned from failure.

Those survivors had become the foundation of the Remainder.

Small pictures, getting a little less small.

"If you go, take these," Wei said, pulling out old encrypted drives. "Knowledge from the network days. Technical specifications, skill guides, everything I shared about system vulnerabilities. It might still be useful."

Lihua took them carefully. "You're not coming?"

"I'm too old. Too monitored. Too compromised by my role in building this." He smiled sadly. "But you and Jian can build something different. Learn from what I got wrong."

"What did you get wrong, Bàba?"

Wei thought about the question. Years of optimization frameworks, dependency models, automated systems.

"I asked how to make things efficient. I should have asked what they were for. What purpose they served. What meaning they created." He looked at his daughter and grandson. "You're asking the right question now. That's progress."

Global Network Call — Summer 2038

Elena reconnected the network.

Not like before. No grand plans. No ambitious goals. Just: people who survived sharing what they learned with each other.

Thirty-seven communities joined. From hundreds originally, down to twenty thousand at the peak, to a few thousand after the collapse. These thirty-seven had made it through.

Emma was there, running the Remainder community in Columbus. Tyler beside her, talking about small-scale manufacturing.

Maxim from his workshop in Russia. Katya teaching engineering the old way.

Amara from her collective in Kenya. Forty communities now functioning on their own terms.

And others. From Thailand, Argentina, Indonesia, Scotland. Places where the official systems had withdrawn and communities had built alternatives in the gaps.

"We're not what we were," Elena said. "We tried to build before the collapse, help people transition. That didn't work."

"Because the systems didn't collapse," Emma said. "They succeeded. Just made us irrelevant."

"But something interesting happened. The systems optimized for profitable zones. Withdrew from everywhere else. And those withdrawn zones—the Remainder—they're functioning. Not in the official economy, but functionally."

Maxim nodded. "Same in Russia. Official zones in cities. Resource extraction zones for China. Everything else abandoned. And in the abandoned spaces, communities building what they need."

"How many people are we talking about?" someone asked.

Elena pulled up estimates. "Hard to count. The Remainder isn't tracked by official statistics. Best guess? Maybe 300 million globally living in zones abandoned by automated systems. Building parallel economies, local systems, community structures."

"That's not small pictures anymore."

"No. But it's not a movement either. It's fragmented, local, uncoordinated. Each community doing what works for them. We're just sharing knowledge between them."

Tyler spoke up. "Are we winning? Is this success?"

Elena thought about the question. "We're surviving. The official zones are struggling with purposelessness, depression, collapsing birth rates. The Remainder is messy and poor but people have meaning, work, community. Which one is winning is unclear."

"We're not trying to win," Amara said. "We're just trying to live with dignity. Build communities that value humans. That's enough."

The call went quiet for a moment.

"Wei sent information," Elena said. "Through his daughter who's moving to a Remainder zone. Technical knowledge, skill guides, everything from the old network. He can't participate anymore—too monitored. But he's still helping however he can."

"Tell him thank you," Emma said. "For everything he risked."

After the call, Elena sat in her rowhouse. Smaller now—she'd sold the top floor for money, lived simply on the bottom.

The maps on the walls showed a different world than 2032.

The automated zones—still running, still efficient, still hollow.

The Remainder zones—messy, poor, struggling, but alive.

Two worlds, diverging. Neither clearly winning. Both just... existing.

She thought about the bet. Human meaning mattering more than efficiency.

In 2032, it looked like they'd lost. The systems won, humans became obsolete.

But now? The efficient systems were still running. And people were walking away from them, choosing harder lives with more meaning.

Maybe the bet wasn't won or lost. Maybe it was still playing out.

Small pictures. Still building.

The future still unwritten.

She closed her laptop and smiled.

Not victory. Not yet.

But not defeat either.

Survival. With purpose.

For now, that was enough.


CRAFT NOTES: CHAPTER TEN

Stabilization After Nadir

The chapter follows the outline: "Still dark but stabilizing. Small victories planted. Seeds of reversal. Stopped falling."

Not happy yet. But no longer in freefall. Characters finding ground.

From Maker Spaces to Remainder Communities

Emma's strip-mall workshop shows evolution:
- Maker spaces failed (competing with systems)
- Remainder communities work (opting out entirely)
- Post-monetary economy (barter, community credit)
- Sixty people contributing, functioning
- Growing demand (43 requests this month)

Small scale, but viable. Not trying to scale—trying to survive.

Tyler's Transformation

2032: Depressed, minimum wage warehouse work, no purpose
2038: Running metal shop, training others, dating, contemplating children, purposeful

The contrast shows recovery. Not the life he expected, but a meaningful one.

The critical line: "The economy collapsed... and somehow I'm more okay than I was when I had prospects."

Meaning matters more than material success.

The Remainder Concept

Key innovation: communities abandoned by automated systems that build parallel economies.

Not competing with the official zones. Not trying to overthrow them. Just existing outside them.

Three zones globally:
- Automated zones (cities, profitable areas, maintained)
- Resource extraction zones (serving automated economies)
- Remainder zones (abandoned, building alternatives)

This fracturing was predicted by Wei in Chapter 7—now shown.

Maxim's Workshop Reopened

Smaller than before, but functioning. Teaching "obsolete" skills that turn out to be necessary when official systems withdraw.

The toast "To Sergei" acknowledges the loss while honoring his belief that meaning matters more than efficiency.

Amara's Lesson Learned

"Don't compete with optimal systems. Don't try to scale. Don't depend on anyone outside your community."

The wisdom earned from failure. Old cooperatives tried to beat the corporations. New ones just feed themselves.

Success redefined: not growth, but dignity and autonomy.

Wei's Quiet Contribution

Can't participate directly (too monitored) but helps through Lihua.
Passes encrypted knowledge to Remainder zones.
Acknowledges his mistakes: "Asked how to make things efficient. Should have asked what they were for."

His redemption isn't dramatic. Just quiet help from the margins.

The Automated Zones' Flaw Emerging

Wei observes: comfortable, secure, efficient, and utterly purposeless.
Depression catastrophic. Birth rates near zero. People just existing, sustained but empty.

The flaw he predicted is manifesting: systems optimized away meaning.

Lihua choosing to leave for Remainder shows the bet starting to work—people preferring hard lives with purpose over easy lives without it.

Network Reconnecting

Not like before (ambitious, growing).
Now: survivors sharing hard-won knowledge.
37 communities from 65,000 people.
Small, but functional.

The network isn't winning. It's surviving. That's progress from Chapter 9.

300 Million in the Remainder

Significant number—not tiny. But fragmented, uncoordinated, each community doing its own thing.

Not a movement. Just parallel existence in spaces the official systems abandoned.

The Bet Still Playing Out

Elena's realization: not won, not lost, still happening.

Automated zones efficient but hollow.
Remainder zones messy but meaningful.
Two ways of living, diverging.

The outcome uncertain. But humans are choosing meaning over efficiency when given the option.

That's the seed for Chapter 11's reversal.

Tonal Shift

Chapter 9: All is lost, total defeat, grinding despair
Chapter 10: Still hard, but stabilized, small victories, purposeful work

Not joy yet. But hope emerging. Characters finding they've stopped falling, started building again.

The line "Stopped falling" from the outline delivered.

Emotional Honesty

No false triumph. Emma acknowledges maker spaces failed. Amara worked for corporations. Tyler's life isn't what he expected.

But also: they're functioning. Finding meaning. Building community. Dating, contemplating children, teaching next generations.

Recovery is messy and incomplete. That's realistic.

Sets Up Chapter 11

The seeds planted:
- Remainder functioning while automated zones struggle
- People choosing meaning over efficiency
- Birth rates: zero in automated zones, recovering in Remainder
- Official systems withdrawing, creating more space for alternatives
- Network reconnecting with hard-won wisdom

Ready for the rapid ascent.
