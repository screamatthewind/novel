# Project Cleanup & File Removal Plan

## Files to Remove/Archive

Based on thorough codebase analysis, here are the obsolete and redundant files that can be cleaned up.

---

## SAFE TO DELETE (Immediate Action)

### 1. Python Cache Files
**Location:** [src/__pycache__/](c:\Users\Bob\source\repos\novel\src\__pycache__)
**Size:** 288 KB (16 .pyc files)
**Reason:** Compiled bytecode cache, auto-regenerated by Python
**Risk:** NONE - Python recreates these automatically
**Action:** Delete entire `__pycache__` directory

### 2. Root-Level Cost Tracking Quick Reference
**File:** [COST_TRACKING_QUICK_REF.md](c:\Users\Bob\source\repos\novel\COST_TRACKING_QUICK_REF.md)
**Size:** 50 lines
**Reason:** Redundant with comprehensive docs in `docs/project/Cost_Tracking_System.md` (263 lines) and `Cost_Tracking_Implementation_Summary.md` (311 lines)
**Risk:** LOW - Just points to other docs
**Action:** Delete

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - MEMORY BANK

**PERMANENT RULE - NEVER FORGET:**

**✅ CORRECT STRUCTURE (AS OF 2025-12-27):**
```
novel/
├── book/                    # Novel content ONLY
│   ├── manuscript/          # 12 chapter files (The_Obsolescence_Chapter_*.md)
│   └── reference/           # Novel Bible and Outline
├── technical_docs/          # ALL technical/project documentation
│   ├── STORYBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
│   ├── TROUBLESHOOTING.md
│   ├── PROJECT_STATUS.md
│   └── ... (21 files total)
├── src/                     # Python scripts
├── images/                  # Generated images
├── audio/                   # Generated audio
└── videos/                  # Generated videos
```

**❌ FORBIDDEN:**
- NO `docs/` folder - it was deleted!
- NEVER put technical docs in `book/`
- NEVER recreate `docs/project/`

**File Path Updates Completed:**
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` ✅
- `src/config.py` - CHAPTER_DIR = `../book/manuscript` ✅
- `src/novel_context.py` - bible_path = `../book/reference/The_Obsolescence_Novel_Bible.md` ✅
- All `technical_docs/*.md` files ✅

---

## SHOULD DELETE (Not Archive - These Don't Belong in Project)

### 3. Old Planning Documents
**Files:**
- [CHARACTER_CONSISTENCY_FIX_PLAN.md](c:\Users\Bob\source\repos\novel\CHARACTER_CONSISTENCY_FIX_PLAN.md) (Dec 26, 182 lines)
- [CHARACTER_ATTRIBUTE_CONSISTENCY_PLAN.md](c:\Users\Bob\source\repos\novel\CHARACTER_ATTRIBUTE_CONSISTENCY_PLAN.md) (Dec 26, 413 lines)

**Current/Active Plan:** [Clothing_Consistency_Fix_Plan.md](c:\Users\Bob\source\repos\novel\Clothing_Consistency_Fix_Plan.md) (Dec 27, 317 lines)

**Reason:** Evolution of planning - older versions superseded by newest plan
**Risk:** VERY LOW - Planning docs, not implementation
**Action:** DELETE (keep only newest plan)

### 4. ✅ COMPLETED - Directory Restructure
**Action Taken:** Moved `docs/` folder to `book/` and `technical_docs/`

**Changes:**
- ✅ `docs/manuscript/` → `book/manuscript/`
- ✅ `docs/reference/` → `book/reference/`
- ✅ `docs/project/` → `technical_docs/`
- ✅ `docs/` folder deleted
- ✅ Updated all file references (CLAUDE.md, config.py, novel_context.py, all technical_docs/*.md)

### 5. Old Log Files
**Location:** [logs/](c:\Users\Bob\source\repos\novel\logs/)
**Files:** 17 log files from Dec 26 (306 KB total)
**Reason:** Old execution logs from testing runs
**Recommendation:** Keep most recent 3-5 logs, archive or delete older ones
**Risk:** LOW - Only needed if debugging historical issues
**Action:** Create `logs/archive/` and move logs older than latest 5

---

## REQUIRES INVESTIGATION (Review Before Deleting)

### 6. Multiple Voice Download Scripts (6 scripts)
**Files in [src/](c:\Users\Bob\source\repos\novel\src/):**
- `download_voices.py` (7,302 bytes)
- `download_voices_simple.py` (10,072 bytes)
- `download_diverse_voices.py` (9,007 bytes)
- `download_real_voices.py` (11,208 bytes)
- `download_vctk_real.py` (9,715 bytes)
- `download_vctk_streams.py` (6,671 bytes)

**Reason:** Six variations from testing different voice sources - likely only 1-2 are actually used
**Risk:** MEDIUM - If voices need re-downloading, might need these
**Action Required:**
1. Check which script(s) are referenced in `.vscode/launch.json`
2. Verify `voices/` directory has all needed samples
3. Keep only the production script(s), delete experimental versions
4. OR archive all to `src/archive/voice_download_experiments/`

---

## KEEP AS-IS (Do Not Delete)

### Documentation (All Required)
- All files in `docs/project/` (except session summaries noted above)
- `docs/project/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current status reference
- `docs/project/STORYBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Active guide
- All Character_References_*.md files
- `docs/project/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### Cache Directories (Intentional Performance Optimization)
- `prompt_cache/` - Cached image prompts (19 .txt files) - Avoids regenerating prompts
- `storyboard_cache/` - Cached storyboard analysis - Saves Claude API costs
- `audio_cache/` - Audio metadata and dialogue caches

### Metadata Files (Production Data)
- All `*_metadata.json` files in character_references/
- All JSON files in audio_cache/
- All JSON files in storyboard_cache/

### Test Scripts (Active Development Tools)
- `src/test_prompt_comparison.py` - Used for testing prompt methods
- `src/test_voice_cloning.py` - Used for testing TTS

### Source Code
- All Python scripts in `src/` (except redundant voice download scripts after review)

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Safe Deletions (5 minutes)
```bash
# Delete Python cache (will auto-regenerate)
rm -rf src/__pycache__/

# Delete redundant quick reference
rm COST_TRACKING_QUICK_REF.md
```

### Step 2: Delete Old Plans (2 minutes)
```bash
# Delete superseded planning docs
rm CHARACTER_CONSISTENCY_FIX_PLAN.md
rm CHARACTER_ATTRIBUTE_CONSISTENCY_PLAN.md
```

### Step 3: Move docs/project/ to technical_docs/ (2 minutes)
```bash
# Move entire docs/project/ folder to root as technical_docs/
mv docs/project technical_docs

# This fixes the docs/ folder rule violation
# docs/ folder should now ONLY contain novel content (manuscript/, reference/)
```

### Step 4: Archive Old Logs (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p logs/archive

# Move logs older than Dec 26 evening (keep latest 5)
# (User can do this manually by checking file dates)
```

### Step 5: Review Voice Download Scripts (10 minutes)
**Manual review required:**
1. Check `.vscode/launch.json` for which scripts are used
2. Verify voice samples exist in `voices/` directory
3. Archive unused scripts to `src/archive/voice_download_experiments/`

---

## Total Space Savings
- Python cache: ~288 KB (will regenerate, so net ~0)
- Documentation: Organizational benefit (no significant space savings)
- Logs: ~200 KB if archived/deleted
- Voice scripts: ~50 KB if unused ones removed
- **Total: < 500 KB** (minimal storage impact)

**Primary Benefit:** Organization and clarity, not storage space
